# MechMania 26 Java Starter Pack
![MechMania 26 Logo](https://mechmania.io/images/MM26LOGO.png)

Welcome to MechMania 26! This is the **Java Starter Pack**. In this repository is the base code to help you get started with the competition.

## The Don'ts
- **Don't** edit any files except for `PlayerStrategy.java`. These other files are necessary for your code to interface with the engine. Messing with them will only cause your player to function incorrectly!
- **Don't** change the return type of `makeDecision` in `PlayerStrategy.java`. Again, if you do, you'll only be hurting yourself.

## The Do's
- **Do** implement your strategy in `PlayerStrategy.java`. This file is used by the rest of our code to send your decision to the game engine. Make sure you return a `CharacterDecision` object.
- ***TODO: create API.java*** ~~**Do** use the helper functions in `API.java` to assist you in implementing your strategy. You can always write your own additional helper functions as well, although we recommend not putting them in `API.java`.~~
- **Do** create new files to help organize your code as you wish!
- **Do** use the objects defined in the `starter_pack.domain.model` package to help you.

## Questions
If you have any questions about the classes and functions given to you here, please ask the MechMania staff on our Discord. Good luck!
